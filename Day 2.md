1. What is IP Address > 
=> An IP address, or Internet Portocol Address, is a unique number that identifies a device connected to the internet or a local network. IP address are used to send receive information between device on a network. 

2. Why ip Addressing ? 
=> IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network and to allow devices to communicate with each other: 
Communication: IP addresses enable devices to send and receive data, such as when you send an email, visit a website, or watch a video. 
Location: IP addresses can be used to identify the location of a device. Hackers can use geolocation technology to identify a user's region, city, and state based on their IP address. 
Troubleshooting: IP addresses can be used to troubleshoot network errors. 
Identifying intruders: IP addresses can be used to 3. 3. identify intruders. 
IP addresses are numeric values that are assigned to every type of network device, including computers, servers, telephones, cameras, printers, and sensors. 
There are two versions of the Internet Protocol (IP) in use today: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are usually written as four octets separated by periods, while IPv6 addresses are typically written as eight sets of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. 

ip address structure 
=> An IP address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a device on a TCP/IP network. it's typically written in dotted-decimal format, with four numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.123.132


Here are some details about IP address structure: 
Parts
An IP address has two parts: a network ID and a host ID. The network ID is the first three numbers of the address, and the host ID is the fourth number. 
Format
Each number in an IP address can range from 0 to 255, so the full IP addressing range is 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. 
Binary
Computers work with IP addresses as 32-bit binary strings. Humans usually convert binary to a dotted decimal address, which is easier to write and understand. 
Subnet masks
Subnet masks clarify which part of the address is the network ID and which is the host ID. 
Subnetting
Subnetting is a way to divide a large network into smaller, more manageable sections. 
CIDR notation
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation combines the address and subnet mask into one representation.
